ooooooo [website](http://jamesmilton.me). 

## jamesmilton.me

This website is the start of my portfolio. I shall eventually build up it's contents with stuff I have made. Feel free to take a look!

It's built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) - a static site generator which is good because it means I can continually add content without the need of a dynamic site. Also it goes hand-in-hand with Github pages, great stuff.

Peace.
