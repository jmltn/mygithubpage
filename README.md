# Hello

You wanna look at my ([website](http://jamesmilton.me)) hey? 

## jamesmilton.me

This website is the start if my portfolio where I shall eventually build up it's contents with stuff I have made. Feel free to take a look!

It's built using ([Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)) - a static site generator which is good because it means I can continually add content without the need of a dunamic site. Also it goes hand-in-hand with Github pages which is even better because Githib pages is so easy to use.

Peace.
