For my A-Level (aged 18) Product Design assignment, I wanted to make a iPhone controlled remote controlled car which could be built with Lego. As a part of this project, I made a logo with Adobe Photoshop for both the branding of the product as well as iPhone icon that went with it.

Below are images of the final outcomes and a time-lapse showing the process of making the licence place from start to finish.

I designed and 3D printed a chassis for the RC car which holds the Raspberry Pi, motor controller unit, rechargeable battery for Raspberry Pi, and 9v battery for motors. As well as this, on the underside of the chassis is lego surface, which allows you to stick lego accessories onto the underside.

I also created a website which is an online instruction manual on how to assemble the lego parts. It can be found [here]({{site.baseurl}}/raspberryrev/).
