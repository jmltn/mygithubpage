###### Commission work for Arup Design (Facade Visualisation)

On the basis of my dissertation about Smart Building data visualisation, I was recruited by the University of Sheffieldâ€™s Estates and Facilities Management (EFM) Department in association with Arup to design and develop a VR system that provides intuitively visual representations of the internal and external environment of the University of Sheffieldâ€™s Diamond Smart Building. The graphical data visualisation techniques I am designing aim to aid performance analysis of the ventilation system in the atrium of the building.

The system below enables representation of the Diamond's outside environment, including, temperature, weather conditions, humidity, CO2 levels, wind direction and speed.

###### Commission work for Arup Design (Sensor Farm)

I have been commissioned to design the research and development â€˜sensor farmâ€™ enclosure for the Urban Flows Observatory organisation. Urban Flows Observatory is a University of Sheffield and â€˜Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Councilâ€™ (EPSRC) funded organisation, which seeks to understand how physical metabolism of cities can be effectively measured, understood and utilised. Within Sheffield, there are several mobile and fixed sensors positioned around the city centre which record environmental data. I am involved in designing the physical enclosure of these sensors which will be used in the understanding and creation of a zero carbon and healthy city.
