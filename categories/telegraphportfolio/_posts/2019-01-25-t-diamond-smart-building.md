###### Computer Science Dissertation (Data Visualisation with VR)

The University of Sheffieldâ€™s Diamond building was designed to be a â€™Smart Buildingâ€™. As such, it contains approximately three thousand sensors which report data about the Diamonds internal environment, including temperature, humidity, co2 levels, seat occupancy, lighting and heating status to a database called a Building Management System (BMS).

Given the quantity of data recorded in the Diamondâ€™s BMS, simplex numerical figures of the buildingâ€™s environment are difficult to understand. With that, understanding the optimum working conditions of the Diamond or diagnosing system faults are hard to comprehend, which can result in an uncomfortable and inefficient building environment.

The buildingâ€™s constructors produced a highly detailed computerised model of the Diamond, known as Building Information Model (BIM).

This project aimed to combine the model from the BIM with the past and present data available in the BMS through 3D graphical visualisations via Virtual Reality (VR). This was done in the hope to improve the understanding of the Diamondâ€™s internal environmental data. From my research, such a graphical and interactive system for a Smart Building BMS
is not known to previously exist in the world.

###### Commission work for Arup Design (Facade Visualisation)

On the basis of my dissertation about Smart Building data visualisation, I was recruited by the University of Sheffieldâ€™s Estates and Facilities Management (EFM) Department in association with Arup to design and develop a VR system that provides intuitively visual representations of the internal and external environment of the University of Sheffieldâ€™s Diamond Smart Building. The graphical data visualisation techniques I designed aim to aid performance analysis of the ventilation system in the atrium of the building.

The system pictured below enables representation of the Diamond's outside environment, including, temperature, weather conditions, humidity, CO2 levels, wind direction and speed.

###### Commission work for Arup Design (Sensor Farm)

I have been commissioned to design the research and development â€˜sensor farmâ€™ enclosure for the Urban Flows Observatory organisation. Urban Flows Observatory is a University of Sheffield and â€˜Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Councilâ€™ (EPSRC) funded organisation, which seeks to understand how physical metabolism of cities can be effectively measured, understood and utilised. Within Sheffield, there are several mobile and fixed sensors positioned around the city centre which record environmental data. I am involved in designing the physical enclosure of these sensors which will be used in the understanding and creation of a zero carbon and healthy city.
