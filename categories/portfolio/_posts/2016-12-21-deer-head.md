One of my A-Level Product Design assignments was to simply make something with a piece of plywood. I can't remember the dimensions. I decided to laser cut a mounted deer head, as I have always liked how striking real life mounted deer heads look, but obviously disagree with unnecessarily killing an animal for aesthetics. 


2d images of parts to come!!

This is the construction of the deer head, using AutoDesk Inventor Professional. I then rendered the deer head without any textures added.

I then added a wood texture and rendered that.

I loaded the 2D CAD drawings onto a Laser Cutter to produce the final products.
