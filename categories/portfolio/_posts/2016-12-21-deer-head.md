One of my A-Level (aged 17) Product Design assignments was to make something from a piece of 30x30cm plywood. I decided to draw and laser cut a 'flatpackable' mounted deer head, as I have always liked how striking real life mounted deer heads look, but obviously disagree with unnecessarily killing of an animal for aesthetics.

Images of the development and final outcome can be found below. The full development for this project can be found in the embedded pdf portfolio below.

This is the construction of the deer head, using AutoDesk Inventor Professional. I then rendered the deer head with and without any textures.

I then added a wood texture and rendered that.

I loaded the 2D CAD drawings onto a Laser Cutter to produce the final products.
