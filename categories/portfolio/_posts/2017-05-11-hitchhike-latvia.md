April 2017, I went hitchhiking across Eurpose with my two friends, Chris and Caitlin.

We hitchhiked in 23 different rides, covering 1860 miles, from Sheffield, United Kingdom to Riga, Latvia. We raised Â£805 for charity along the way.

Below is a playlist of footage from the 9 days we were travelling, starting with the summary video.
