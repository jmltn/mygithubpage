April 2017, I went hitchhiking with my two friends, Chris and Caitlin. 

We hitchhiked 23 different rides, covering 1860 miles, across Europe to Riga, Latvia and raised Â£805 for charity on the way. 

Below is a playlist of footage from the 9 days we were travelling, starting with the summary video.
