I have a 'healthy' obsession towards my Cavalier Spaniel and Poodle crossbreed (Cavapoo) dog, called Jeff. As such, here are few Photoshop doodle's I have made with Jeff as my inspiration.

I wanted to make an eye catching sticker which incorporates Jeff and my website in a fun way. Regardless of the currency, I figured a sticker which at a glance could be recognised as a $100 bill would do the trick. Created with Photoshop, there are just enough differences between this sticker and a real $100 bill to keep me out of trouble for counterfeiting.

I wanted to experiment with the functionality available with HTML5 animations, as such I made this [site](../jeff/){:target="_blank"} about Jeff.

The image below was created using Adobe Photoshop, it is inspired by the iconic OBEY clothing brand.
