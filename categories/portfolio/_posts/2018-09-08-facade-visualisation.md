On the basis of my dissertation about Smart Building data visualisation, I was recruited by the University of Sheffield’s Estates and Facilities Management (EFM) Department in association with Arup to design and develop a VR system that provides intuitively visual representations of the internal and external environment of the University of Sheffield’s Diamond Smart Building. The graphical data visualisation techniques I am designing aim to aid performance analysis of the ventilation system in the atrium of the building.

The system below enables representation of the Diamond's outside environment, including, temperature, weather conditions, humidity, CO2 levels, wind direction and speed.
