Me and my 'handsome' mate [Seb](https://www.instagram.com/seb_langmead/) are embarking on a little trip to Asia!

July 9th, we fly from London, U.K to Hong Kong and spend 5 days exploring there. Next, we fly from Hong Kong to Hanoi, (north) Vietnam. We have a month to explore Vietnam and it's neighbouring countries. When the month is up, we fly from Ho Chi Minh City, (south) Vietnam back home to London. The next day, my 'dapper' mate  [Aaron](https://www.instagram.com/aaronvvright/) joins the crew and we fly to Helsinki, Finland, but that's whole other adventure...

I will be documenting the trip through via [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4G3WR8U8Uk0OY62jD1Ut_w). Below is a playlist of all my Asia uploads thus far.
