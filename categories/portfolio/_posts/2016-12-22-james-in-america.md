In 2013 my family and I embarked on a road trip coast-to-coast across the United States of America. I created this blog using [Anchor](https://anchorcms.com){:target="_blank"}, a CMS (content management system). This blog was updated almost daily throughout the 2 month adventure.

 This was once a dynamic website, but since the page is no longer being updated, I converted it to a static page using the [GNU wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/){:target="_blank"} from the Free Software Foundation.

*During the time of [this blog post](../jamesinamerica/blog/heart-of-america.html){:target="_blank"}, we were in the state of Iowa and my sister and I were asked to be interviewed live on 6pm Channel 13 News at the Iowa State Fair. During the interview, I told the viewers to check out my blog. If you look down at the comments, I got some great responses. From that point on, my blog was getting hundred's of views day.*
