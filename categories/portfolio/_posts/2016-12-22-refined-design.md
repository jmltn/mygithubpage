This is just a generic website I made for a 'Web and Internet Technology' module which I took during my first year of University. The website has been designed for a 'freelance digital designer' in mind.

The website also involves a fun 2D JavaScript game that I made, which can be found [here]({{site.baseurl}}/refineddesign/demo.html){:target="_blank"}.
