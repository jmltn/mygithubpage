This is my first attempt of making a Twitterbot.

[@yo_inquisitor](https://twitter.com/yo_inquisitor){:target="_blank"} will tweet every 1-2 hours. He'll either tweet a random celebrity a random question; tweet a random active user a random question; or tweet a random thought or quote with a trending hashtag (these can sometimes prove to be controversial).

He's been constantly running since May 2017 and has picked up a few followers along the way...
