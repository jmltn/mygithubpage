Between the 25th and 26th April 2019, The CIBSE Technical Symposium 2019 was hosted at the University of Sheffield’s Diamond building. The 2019 Technical Symposium provided an opportunity to examine and share research, development and applications that will drive change in the regulation, creation and maintenance of the built environment.

While studying Computer Science at the University of Sheffield, I investigated a solution to improving understanding of smart building data as part of my final year dissertation project, which was supervised by Dr Ramsay Taylor. By marrying a computer games engine with a BIM model, I was able to create a 3D visualisation of the environmental performance of Sheffield University’s complex Diamond building.

My dissertation paper was submitted to The CIBSE Technical Symposium 2019 and I was invited to present at the symposium. My presentation and paper explaining how it was done was named the ‘Most Significant Contribution to the Art and Science of Building Services’ at the 2019 CIBSE Technical Symposium. Additionally, a magazine spread was written about my project in the CIBSE journal.
