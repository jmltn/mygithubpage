Going back to my Product Design A-Level, I wanted to make a iPhone controlled remote controlled car which could be built with Lego. 

As a part of this project, I made a logo for both the branding of the product as well as iPhone icon that went with it.

Below is a time-lapse showing the process of making the licence place from start to finish.
