title: What is the project?

Project proposed by Dr Ramsay Taylor - Virtual and/or Augmented Reality Views on a Building.

The Diamond<sup>1</sup> was designed to be a “Smart Building”. As such, it contains approximately 3000 sensors reporting *temperature*, *humidity*, *CO2 levels*, *seat occupancy*, *lighting* and *heating status*, and much more.

This data is fed to the Building Management System (BMS)<sup>2</sup> to control the building, and it is hoped that the BMS can be used to improve the user experience of the building. It would also be nice if individual users could optimise their own use of the building based on personal preferences, using the vast amount of information about the building state that is available.

Given the quantity of data, simple presentations of figures such as temperatures and occupancy levels of rooms are not particularly easy to use. Although the data will facilitate searching for specific details, it would be nice to have a more intuitive way of viewing the data and understanding the building’s state.

As well as the considerable level of instrumentation, the building’s designers and constructors produced a Building Information Model (BIM)<sup>3</sup>. Combining the models from the BIM with near-live data from the building’s instrumentation would allow a 3D representation of the current state of the building.

This could provide both a more natural and interactive way for researchers to understand the building’s behaviour, and potentially, a better way for users to interact with the data.

Whether the data is presented as a Virtual Reality<sup>4</sup> system or as an Augmented Reality system<sup>5</sup>, overlayed on the real building as a user walks around, will be up to the student.

<sup>1</sup> The Diamond is a six-storey, aluminium and diamond shaped facade exterior smart building, home to engineering undergraduates. It contains specialist teaching facilities including a range of lecture theatres, seminar rooms, open-plan learning spaces, library and IT services, and space for informal study including a cafe. It cost the University of Sheffield £81m to build.  
<sup>2</sup> A Building Management System is a computer based control system that controls a building's 'settings' such as its ventilation, lighting, heating etc. It could be considered the 'heart' of any 'smart building'.  
<sup>3</sup> Building Information Model is a (large) collection of 3D models that show all aspects of the building’s structure and contents.  
<sup>4</sup> Virtual reality is a computer technology that displays realistic and lifelike images and sounds onto a human headset, to simulate a user's physical presence into virtual environment.  
<sup>5</sup> Augmented Reality is a view reality, but modified by a computer. Augmented reality enhances perception on 'real-life' reality, whereas virtual reality replaces 'real-life' reality with a simulation.
