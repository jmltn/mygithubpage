title: Getting to know Unity 3D game engine
---

Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies, which is primarily used to develop video games and simulations for computers, consoles and mobile devices. I will be using Unity for this project due to it's cross-compatibility across multiple devices and wide functionality.

To get to grips with the software, I made a quick game called 'Roll a Ball', where the aim is to collect all of the 'pick ups'.
