title: Expanding the system to work in an another room
---

**Progress Update**
I have now successfully integrated temperature, CO2 and air-conditioning data from the buildingâ€™s BMS database to a second room in the Diamond. This second room (computer room 2) is a square share and has many more sensors.

The challenge with doing this was figure out how to implement the system to work in a room with only two sensors, but with n sensors. 

Other improvements have been made with this progress update, including more efficient retrieval and handling of data from the database, cleaner UI and the system has now been exported as a standalone Mac/Windows application.
