In 2013 my family and I embarked on a road trip across the USA.I created this blog using [Anchor](https://anchorcms.com){:target="_blank"}, a CMS. This was once a dynamic website, but since the page is no longer being updated, I converted it to a static page using [GNU wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/){:target="_blank"} from the Free Software Foundation.
